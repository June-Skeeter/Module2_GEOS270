# Raster Data

A simple but storage intensive method for representing data that is widely ustilized in GIS.  Rasters are commonly encountered as: satellite and drone imagery, elevation models, climate data, model outputs, and scanned maps.   

<div style="overflow: hidden;

## File Types

Raster data can come in many different formats.  **GeoTIFF** which has the extension .tif is one of the most common/functional is the .  This format is based of the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a common file type used by graphic artists and photographers.  A TIFF file stores metadata (data about the data) as tags.  For instance, your camera might store a tag that describes the make and model of the camera and another for the date the photo was taken when it saves a picture. A GeoTIFF is a standard .tif image format plus additional tags spatial tags denoting spatial information including: 

* Extent (minimum x,y and maximum x,y)
* Resolution (cell size)
* Projection, Coordinate system, and datum

Other file types you will likely encounter when working with raster data include:
* 1) IMG - A proprietary image format commonly used by ESRI products
* 2) JPEG2000 - A geospatial version of the common .jpg image type
* 3) ASCII - An older human readable format (simple text file) with slower performance than the types listed above.
