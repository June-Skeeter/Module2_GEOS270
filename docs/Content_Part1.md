# A Bit About Data

Before we think about how we represent data in a GIS specifically, we need to take a step back and think about what data is?

* Data is information describing some phenomenon.

* The **type of phenomenon** being represented will often influence *how* we represent it.

* There are different types of data too.  Some is numeric, some is purely descriptive.  Different types of data have different rules we must consider when working with them.

* Spatial data is special!  There are unique considerations we need to make.
