# Assessment Questions

### QC3

______ objects have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a ______ number of them.

### QC4

______ fields lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an ______ number of locations.

### QC5

Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the raster or vector data model.  However, ______ phenomena are generally better represented by the vector model and ______ phenomena are better represented by the raster data model.

### QC6

Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store [T/F]

### QC7 

The ______ problem pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.

### QC8

Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].

### QC9

Polygons in a vector dataset can be single part or multipart [T/F].

### WC1

Briefly discuss what resolution means with regards to raster and vector data.   -->
