# Which spatial data model is best?

No single data model is suitable for all types of data or analysis.  Many times you will use both raster and vector data in the same analysis.  There is not a "best" model.  Vector data is better for some situations, raster data is better for others.  The type of data model use to represent something is dependent on a number of factors.  A key consideration is the **Type of Phenomenon** being represented.

# Assessment Questions

### QC3

______ objects have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a ______ number of them.

### QC4

______ fields lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an ______ number of locations.

### QC5

Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the raster or vector data model.  However, ______ phenomena are generally better represented by the vector model and ______ phenomena are better represented by the raster data model.

### QC6

Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store [T/F]

### QC7 

The ______ problem pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.

### QC8

Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].

### QC9

Polygons in a vector dataset can be single part or multipart [T/F].

### WC1

Briefly discuss what resolution means with regards to raster and vector data.
