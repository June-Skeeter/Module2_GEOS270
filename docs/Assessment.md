* Scores & categories are general guides, you TA may assign scores between these levels
* Your TA will provide brief comments where applicable, if you need more feedback you can follow up with your TA.

# Lecture Content Questions 

[**1**](Content_Part1_1.md)
______ have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a finite number of them.

[**2**](Content_Part1_1.md)
______ lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an infinite number of locations.

[**3**](Content_Part1_1.md)
We rarely work with multiple types of phenomena at once in GIS because it is too complicated. [T/F]

[**4**](Content_Part1_2.md)
For these data types, we cannot calculate meaningful numerical statistics.  (Select all that apply).

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio

[**5**](Content_Part1_2.md)
Briefly discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative data and their respective sub-types.

[**6**](Content_Part2_0.md)
Negative spatial autocorrelation indicates clustering. [T/F]

[**7**](Content_Part2_1.md)
The ______ data model represents space as a continuous grid of cells and each cell can contain only one attribute.

[**8**](Content_Part2_2.md)
The ______ data model represents features in space as discrete two-dimensional polygons, one-dimensional lines , and/or "zero-dimensional" points.  Attribute(s) are stored separately in a table, and each row can have numerous attributes.

[**9**](Content_Part2_2.md)
Polygons can be single part or multipart [T/F].

[**10**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the data model.  But generally speaking, continuous fields phenomena are better represented by the ______ model and discrete objects are better represented by the ______ data model.

[**11**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store. [T/F]

[**12**](Content_Part2_3.md)
The ______ pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.

[**13**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].
